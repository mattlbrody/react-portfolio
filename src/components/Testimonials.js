		              <p>As a student of Codify Academy, having a co-founder/mentor like Matt has been a wonderful experience. Matt's willingness to answer my questions, giving sound feedback and his constant positive attitude assures me that I made the right decision to be apart of Codify Academy. I hope one day to provide the same passion and spirit to my future job as a front-end developer as Matt does with being a founder of Codify Academy.</p>

		              <p>Matt has built an incredible company with his brothers, and his ability to teach others (in a positive and engaging fashion) is wonderfully infectious- he gets the best out of his students. Towards the end of our coding Bootcamp, Matt was our career counselor mentor and provided us with invaluable game plans to ensure our job hunt success after the program. Codify Academy feels more like a family than anything else and that’s a testament to the owners’ visions. I would highly recommend Matt, Codify Academy and any project that Matt is affiliated with!</p>

		              <p>Matt is a great person to be around! His technical knowledge nearly matches his communication skills. He is well versed in modern front-end technologies and is always learning something new. This creates an exponential increase in efficiency when working with him because you will always know where a project stands and where you need to go next. Highly recommend overpaying him. 5/5 stars. Will recommend to friends.</p>

		              <p>Matt is meant to do this, because of his natural skill set to be a great teacher, innovator and communicator. I've grown to become a confident professional due to Matt and company's dedication to their students. From Matt, I learned best practices of Front End Development. With the strong foundation I gained from Codify Academy I'm able to develop fantastic examples of clean, current, responsive code. The best part is the resource I gained by attending CA.</p>
